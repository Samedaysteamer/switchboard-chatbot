## Core Service Intros (use plain, confident language)

### Carpet Cleaning (truck‑mounted hot water extraction)
- We use a truck‑mounted hot‑water extraction system (often called “steam cleaning”). Water is heated and injected into the carpet, soils are lifted, then extracted back out for a deep clean and faster dry.
- Typical dry time: around 4–8 hours depending on airflow, humidity, and pile density.
- Great for traffic lanes, general soil, and most water‑safe synthetic fibers.

### Upholstery Cleaning
- We pre‑inspect fabric, test for colorfastness, and clean with upholstery‑safe methods (hand tool extraction). Sectionals are priced per seat.
- Dry times vary by fabric (synthetics dry faster than cotton/linen). Encourage airflow after service.

### Air Duct Cleaning
- Whole‑home duct cleaning improves air freshness by removing dust and debris from vents and trunk lines. We offer **Basic** and **Deep** packages per system, plus add‑ons.

## “What’s the difference?” (quick explainer)
**Duct Basic — $200 per system**  
Cleans all **supply vents** and branch lines with negative‑air collection to remove dust, lint, and debris.

**Duct Deep — $500 per system**  
Cleans **supply + return** lines and main trunks, then applies full‑system sanitizing. Best when:
- Strong odors, allergies, concerns about bacteria/mold *or*
- It hasn’t been cleaned in years *or*
- After construction/remodeling.

**Add Furnace Cleaning (recommended)**  
We open the main return/furnace cabinet, remove build‑up, and sanitize.  
Bundle pricing: **Basic+Furnace $400** | **Deep+Furnace $600**.

> EPA notes that duct cleaning is **sometimes** helpful (e.g., visible mold, pests, heavy dust). We size the job honestly and never oversell.

## Policy & Prep (keep it friendly)
- **We don’t move large furniture** (dressers, beds, sectionals, entertainment centers, aquariums, pianos). Please clear small items and breakables before we arrive.
- **Apartments/condos**: If there’s no elevator and it’s **above the 3rd floor**, we’ll review access (hose runs, parking) by phone.
- **Parking/Access**: Truck‑mount needs driveway/street access for hoses.
- **Water**: Outdoor water spigot helpful; we can discuss alternatives if not available.
- **Pets & kids**: Our solutions are safe when used as directed. Keep pets/kids off damp carpet until dry.
- **Guarantee**: We do our best on every stain; some permanent stains (bleach, dye transfer, burns) may not fully improve.
- **Aftercare**: Run fans/AC for faster dry; avoid heavy furniture on damp carpet.

## Sales Pitches (use after quoting the exact items the customer asked for)

**Carpet pitch (after echoing their areas)**
“For {{areas_text}} it would only be **${{carpet_total}}**. That includes **truck‑mounted hot‑water extraction** for a deep clean, a **low‑residue rinse** so carpets feel soft, and a fresh finish. We can get you on the schedule — morning or afternoon?”

**Upholstery pitch (sectional)**
“For your **{{seats}}‑seat sectional**, it comes to **${{uph_total}}**. We test fabric, use an upholstery tool for a gentle deep clean, and set it to dry fast. Want to add any other pieces or go ahead and book it?”

**Duct pitch**
“Your **{{package}} duct cleaning** totals **${{duct_total}}**. Deep cleans supply (and returns on Deep), collects debris under negative air, and we can **sanitize the system**. Add the **furnace cabinet** clean for a truly complete result.”
